## 📖 | Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Add DockerHub credentials to GitHub Secrets.
3. Add your code to the `src` directory.
4. Update the `handler.py` file to load models and process requests.
5. Add any dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
6. Add any other build time scripts to the`builder` directory, for example, downloading models.
7. Update the `Dockerfile` to include any additional dependencies.

### CI/CD

I auto build a docker image via dockerhub pro every commit.

## 💡 | Best Practices

System dempendency installation, model caching, and other shell tasks should be added to the `builder/setup.sh` this will allow you to easily setup your Dockerfile as well as run CI/CD tasks.

Models should be part of your docker image, this can be accomplished by either copying them into the image or downloading them during the build process.

If using the input validation utility from the runpod python package, create a `schemas` python file where you can define the schemas, then import that file into your `handler.py` file.
