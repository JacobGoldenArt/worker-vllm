## 📖 | Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Add DockerHub credentials to GitHub Secrets.
3. Add your code to the `src` directory.
4. Update the `handler.py` file to load models and process requests.
5. Add any dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file.
6. Add any other build time scripts to the`builder` directory, for example, downloading models.
7. Update the `Dockerfile` to include any additional dependencies.

### CI/CD

I auto build a docker image via dockerhub pro every commit.

## 💡 | Best Practices

System dempendency installation, model caching, and other shell tasks should be added to the `builder/setup.sh` this will allow you to easily setup your Dockerfile as well as run CI/CD tasks.

Models should be part of your docker image, this can be accomplished by either copying them into the image or downloading them during the build process.
